Three types of seats: first class, business and economy

Airline Admin: Create and update each type of seat, set the total number of seats per flight
Airline Manager: Approve new prices or updates

When a customer buys a ticket, the system should be able to calculate how many seats are left. If all seats have been purchased, the application should not let customers purchase more seats.

Customers should be able to select their seats by selecting the following options

Departure
destination city
Travel date
Number of travelers

Flights are displayed to customers when they select their seats and confirm their flight itinerary booking

When the customer approves the itinerary, the customer will be asked to pay and a page with the total price should be displayed. 
When a customer presses the pay button, the transaction is considered completed and the seat is marked as sold.
Once a seat is sold, send the customer an email with their flight itinerary.
